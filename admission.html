                <h2>Admissions:</h2><br><br>
                <p style="font-size:1.9vh;">
                   Each year, approximately 100 extremely gifted students are selected to attend the Order of Pangea
                   through a vigorous application process. To be considered for admission, students must demonstrate
                   exceptional intelligence and passion for learning about our world and working to improve it.

                   Pangea does not look at traditional test scores such as ACT or SAT, but instead focuses on finding
                   the brightest young minds of our world who share our deep values and passion for intellectual
                   pursuits through an exclusive and vigorous interview process. Proffesional recommendations are also
                   highly influential in our decision to admit a student.

                   Students interested in applying to the Order of Pangea must fill out a preliminary online application
                   to share their experience, ambitions, and areas of interest. If we deem the student may be a good fit
                   for our school, we will reach out to them to begin the interview process. Only 2.6% of students who
                   begin the interview process ultimately end up accepted at Pangea.

                            The Order of Pangea believes that all students, regardless of financial background, deserve
                            equal opportunity to challenge themselves academically. That is why tuition at Pangea is
                            completely free. Also, room and board in the ship´s luxury living quarters, travel expenses
                            to and from the school for holidays, and any other expenses required for a student´s life
                            while attending our school, are covered by the government of the Sovereign Nation of Pangea.
