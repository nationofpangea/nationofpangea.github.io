                <h2>Overview:</h2><br>
                <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                    The Order of Pangea is founded around an idea of more personalized, experience-based, and
                    boundary-pushing approach to education of the gifted. The way that our curriculum works is that
                    students will have a concentration, and when we travel to offsite locations, they will have special
                    projects that will contribute the students' knowledge about their concentration and help others.
                    During traveling time, students will work on hands on individual and team projects.
                </p>

                <h2>Required Courses:</h2><br>

                <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                    The only required courses for all students at the Order of Pangea is Pangobian, to ensure that the
                    entire student body is fluent in its national language. Attendance in the Pangobian classes is
                    mandatory until students demonstrate complete written and verbal fluency in the language. However,
                    students will also be encouraged to learn the languages of all of the cultures that the school
                    visits.
                </p>

                <h2>Grading:</h2><br>

                <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                    The Order of Pangea has no grading system; students either fail or pass all classes they take. They
                    will be evaluated based on the work they complete and their contributions. If a student is
                    passionate about the learning the subject and makes improvements throughout the course, they will
                    pass the class.

                    However, if a student puts little effort into a class and is not motivated to try and learn the
                    subject matter, they will fail the class and have a discussion with their PAII and the Principal to
                    discuss their options. The Order of Pangea staff understands that sometimes students are simply not
                    passionate about a certain subject, and they will try to help the student find other areas they can
                    excel in instead. However, if a student is not putting effort into any courses they take at our
                    school, we will be forced to expel them from Pangea.
