               <h2>The Soveriegn Nation of Pangea:</h2><br>
               <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                   The Order of Pangea is located in and makes up the majority of the Sovereign Nation of Pangea, which
                   was founded as a sovereign principally in 2019. The Sovereign Nation of Pangea exists on a
                   seven-level top-of-the-line cruise ship and the 12 nautical mile radius of sovereign waters that
                   surrounds it wherever it is currently located. All students at the Order of Pangea become citizens of
                   the Sovereign Nation of Pangea, and must learn its language, Pangobian.

                   The ship travels at 20 knots and has a maximum capacity of 1,300 passengers.

               <h2>Our Ship:</h2><br>

               <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                   The Order of Pangea is massive and unique, like the imagination of our students. The ship spans seven
                   floors. Each floor serves multiple purposes to cater to the multitude of personalities of Sovereign
                   Nation of Pangea students. The bottom floor is where the server room, student and faculty storage,
                   and administrator housing is, this floor students need teacher access to enter. The second floor has
                   some household commodities, such as a kitchen and laundry room, it also features a gym and extra
                   unused rooms that can be utilized for new, special projects and gatherings. The third level is a
                   student favorite, the entertainment floor. The entertainment floor has many spectacular features,
                   This floor is a sanctuary for different forest animals; the landscape of it models a forest adorned
                   with live forest animals: deer, porcupines, foxes, birds, bugs, insects, jaguars, bears, etc... The
                   area with wildlife is contained for zoologist students, under supervision, will help to upkeep. This
                   floor has a river running through it for students enjoyment. Some of the entertainment rooms include
                   many recreational activities: movies, a library, a gaming room, etc... The fourth floor is where most
                   of the stationary learning happens. Here, students will find their physical and digital resources,
                   study rooms, experimentation rooms and labs, and a meeting room for each concentration. The fifth
                   floor is the residential hall. Students will have their own room, but will share a common area and
                   two bathrooms with three other students. The final floor is the defense floor, for the extremely
                   unlikely situation that we are attacked.

               <h2>Language:</h2><br>

               <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                   The Sovereign Nation of Pangea has established its own language, Pangobian, to distinguish itself
                   from existing countries. This language is very important to our school as it serves to ensure an
                   unbiased cultural perspective in which our students from all parts of the world can be educated
                   without favoring influences from an country or culture.

                   This site has been translated into English for the convenience of prospective student who are
                   English-speaking, but once a student is enrolled in the Order of Pangea, they will be exclusively
                   communicate in Pangobian. Students will begin taking Pangobian lessons as soon as they arrive at the
                   school and will continue until they demonstrate fluency in the language.
               </p>

                          <h2>Student Life:</h2><br>

                          <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                              When students apply to the school, they will choose a skill. Their skill will be their
                              concentration for the next few years of their life. We will travel the world, stopping in
                              many countries to learn from other nation and cultures, so that students will cultivate a
                              vast understanding of their concentration. Students will have their own Holographic Personal AI
                              Instructor (HPAII) that appears as a hologram that will assist, instruct, aid, and nourish
                              them; therefore, each student gets the individual attention that they need.

                              Students have free range over their education and are responsible for their own progress,
                              supervised by their HPAII. If progress is not being made, students will be eligible for
                              evaluation, where they can be kicked out of the school. Students will have to coordinate
                              to complete team assignments. All school facilities will function 24 hours a day,
                              administrators and faculty will rotate to supervise and help students, in addition to
                              HPAIIs who will also be available and easily accessible to students. As we encourage
                              independence, students will be responsible for balancing recreational and studying time.
                              The only planned, mandatory time for students is brief class meetings to assign work,
                              school assemblies, and off campus visits.
                          </p>

                          <p style="font-size:2vh;">
                              While The Order of Pangea is an academic facility, it is also the home of our students.
                              Students are on board for the entire year, with a month off to visit family. The family,
                              however, can plan a visit anytime during the school year. We encourage a friendly and
                              healthy environment enforced by staff, faculty, and PAIIs. Students will cultivate long
                              life friendships on board and learn from their diverse set of peers. We hope that you will
                              consider the school of Pangea and apply for the next school year.
